# S3 Event Client Library

This Go package provides a client library for handling S3 events, particularly focusing on receiving notifications related to changes in an S3 bucket, like file uploads.

## Overview

The library offers a convenient way to interact with S3 event notifications through a structured API. It simplifies the process of connecting to, receiving, and processing S3 bucket events.

## Key Features

- **Client Initialization**: Easy setup of the client with customizable options.
- **Receive S3 Events**: Method to handle incoming S3 events, like file uploads, with support for context-based execution.
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses for different HTTP status codes (400 for Bad Request, 500 for Internal Server Error).

## Usage

Create a new client instance and use it to receive and process S3 events. The client can be customized with various options.

### Example

```go
client := client.NewClient() // Initialize the client with default options

// Create a context
ctx := context.Background()

// Define an S3 event
s3Event := &sdk.S3Event{
    // Initialize S3 event data
}

// Receive and process the S3 event
response, err := client.ReceiveS3Event(ctx, s3Event)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Use the response
fmt.Println(response)
```

## Error Handling

Errors are returned with detailed information, allowing for precise issue identification and resolution.

## Configuration

The client can be configured with custom options like base URL, HTTP client, and custom headers to suit different environments and requirements.
